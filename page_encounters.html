          <p>
            The first encounter of this raid is essentially a game of leap frog. 
            Here are the basics to know: The boss will periodically spawn "voltaic overflows," which need to be picked up in under 5 seconds, otherwise they will explode and wipe the entire team. 
            Any player can pick them up by running into them once placed on the ground by the boss, but cannot pick up anymore without dying until a timer, seen on the left-hand side of the screen, reaches zero.
            The team is also introduced to the tether boxes in this room, which will be used in almost every encounter going forward. 
            These boxes allow Gaurdians to physically line up in-game, creating a line between the start box and end box.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fireteam will split into two teams, consisting of 3 Gaurdians each. 
            One team, or usually then designated as "Team 1" will stay in the first room, collecting voltaic overflows until "Team 2" finsihes their task. 
            This other team will start by opening a barrier via connecting a tether box, then running into the second room. 
            They must be fast, clearing out all of the enemies, which activates another tether box, which they must once again link. 
            Upon doing so, the boss will then teleport from the first room, to the second room, where it will now start spawning more voltaic overflows. 
            Now the roles swap: Team 2 starts picking up, while Team 1 runs past Team 2, into the third (and final) room, repeating the intial process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once all three rooms have been cleared, all voltaic overflow collected, and the team has now met back together right after the third room in this "interlude area." 
            Here, they connect a longer series of multiple tether boxes, which will open up the final barrier that leads to the "final stand" of the encounter. 
            The full fireteam will have to race acorss a wide open field, which dozens of massive turret enemies called Cyclopes firing at the team.
            While each member is running for their lives, the boss will continue to drop voltaic overflows on the floor. 
            The rules do not change here: these still need to be picked up almost instantly. 
            Once the third voltaic overflow is placed by the boss, and collected, the encounter ends.

          <h2>Encounter 2: Summon the Consecrated Mind</h2>
          <h1>
            <image src="encounter2.webp" alt="Map of Encounter 2"

          </h1>
          <p>
            Encounter 2 is best understood by understanding a baseball diamond: you have home plate, then first, second, and third base. 
            The players all start at home, and actually must run the opposite direction, dropping off a player at each base/plate as they reach them. 
            In truth, it is easier to understand the shape by understanding a baseball diamond, but the actual callouts that people make while playing are often just "1, 2, 3, and 4," sequentially labeled for hwo players get dropped off.
            Players must defend each base, or properly known as a "relay" from incoming enemy forces.
            Waves of enemies will get harder occasionally (keep reading).
          </p>
          <p>
            The "dropping off" during the encounter is how the team gets set up. 
            The encounter starts when any player runs off the starting platform. 
            One member stays at 1 to gaurd it, while the rest of the team runs to relay 2. 
            Once there, the group will collaborate to kill the enemies that are gaurding it, then two things occur: another defender and runner (see below) reamin at relay 2, while the remaining three players run to relay 3, which is directly acors the map from relay 1. 
            The process repeats, even though the intial group of players is significantly smaller than at the start. 
            Even when it comes to getting to relay 4, usually, the final defender runs there by themselves, being met by the runner for 3-4 after a short delay.
          </p>
          <p>
            Runners have an important job once each defender is at their respective relay. 
            The runners must use either the provided portal on the outer edges of the arena to travel between relays, refreshing a buff to the player call "enlightened." 
            This buff is given to both the relay defender and runer once they complete a tether box that sits a few yards in front of the relay, and the top of the relay itself. 
            This buff allows anyone who has it to shoot and kill enemies that appear to have a white shield. 
            Without this buff, these enemies will continue their push to the relay, begin to sacrafice themselves, then eventually wipe the entire team.
            So, the runner must communicate with their two defenders to ensure that they both are enlightened at all times.
          </p>
          <p>
            After some time, each relay will be faced with an "Angelic Round," where three semi-shielded, large enemies will be added to the current wave of enemies assaulting the relays. 
            They do more damage, have more health, and are harder to kill. 
            However, as your Gaurdian is very powerful with their abilities and super ability, these enemies usually are there to make sure you are killing all attackers within a timely fashion. 
            Usually, the runner is able to assit this defender, as only one relay will be attacked by Angelics at any given moment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once all Angelic Rounds have been successfully defended against, the middle of the arena will open up, and all Gaurdians will make their way to the center. 
            Here, there will be one central relay and one tether box. 
            Now, working as one unit, the team of six will defend this central relay for a few more rounds. 
            Be careful to watch out for Angelics, still. 
            Not only do they tend to hide in the inner catacombs of the relay array, but these enemies will lock the tether box, so long as they are alive, so be sure to eliminate them quickly. 
            Eventually, a message will appear saying "undergrowth defenses subsided," and the encounter is over.

          <h2>Encounter 3: Defeat the Consecrated Mind</h2>
          <h1>

            Once again the team will split into two, each consisting of three Gaurdians. 
            The teams, though once again seperating, will have entirely different objectives. 
            However, so long as these objectives are maintained and completed, the team will be able to defeat the boss we saw during the first encounter.
          </p>
          <p>
            One team is the "Eyes Team."
            Their job is to follow the boss around the arena, as it will once again place voltaic overflows on the ground. 
            As this encounter is not long, this team must be percise with what they do. 
            Recall, that picking up an overflow will create a timer which prevents the Gaurdian from picking another overflow up, unless they want to die. 
            The person who picks up the overflow this time now has another job. 
            Once they have picked up the overflow, they must then call out to the other two members either "inside" or "outside." 
            These callouts correlate to the boss' face, as it has many glowing eyes. With this picked up, only that player can see which ring of eyes needs to be shot (ie., the inside or outside circle of eyes). 
            Failure to do so will kill the player with the voltaic overflow buff, significantly lowering the chances that the encounter will continue and reach the damage phase, though not impossible. 
            This depends on the speed of the Motes Team.
          </p>
          <p>
            The "Motes Team" is the other set of three Gaurdians. 
            There job is to prepare the boss to be damaged. To do so, they must bank "motes" to one of the four relays from the previous encounter, which is randomly selected at the start of this encounter. 
            To ensure the randomly selected relay is defended, usually the first person to collect motes only collects 5, runs to the relay, deposits the motes to become "enlightened," then defends the relay until the next teammate comes to swap off with the original defender. 
            The term "5-10-10-5" is often used to describe how many motes are needed to completely fill the relay, needing 30 motes total; this summons the boss to the relay's location, which starts the damage phase. 
            Motes are collected by killing large, highlighted enemies called "Minotaurs," which drop 5 motes on defeat. 
            Once the relay is ready, a message will display to the entire team, telling everyone that damage is about to start. 
            The boss will then show all of it's eyes, similar to what the "Eyes Team" was shooting to destory during their mission, yet now everyone is required to shoot them. 
            Once all the eyes are deactivated, damage begins. 
            Once the fireteam does neough damage to the boss, the encounter ends.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are some other notes for this encounter: 
            Once the boss is able to take damage, the team must slowly walk after the boss, as not only does it begin to slowly back away from the fireteam, but if anyone gets too far away from the team, a barrier wall will spawn to block out any Gaurdians left behind. 
            This significantly reduces the overall damages able to be done to the boss, but does not wipe the team. 
            Also, enemies will once again try to attack the relay, so the enlightened buff the Motes Team gathers is imperitive to killing these enemies and preventing any sacrafice, as any sacrafice will remove motes from the total amount deposited.

          <h2>Encounter 4: Defeat The Sanctified Mind</h2>
          <h1>
            <image src="encounter4.webp" alt="Map of Encounter 4"
            width="500"
            height="300">
          </h1>
          <p>
            Welcome to the final boss: The Sanctified Mind - A Vex who has merged with the Darkness within the Garden of Salvation (I won't explain the lore of Destiny 2, go watch any number of 7-hour videos to understand). 
            Arguably the most annyoing and difficult to understand boss fight to understand in the entirety of the game. 
            However, here's how to get it done.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the mechanics we've learned from the past encounters make a reappearance here, minus the "voltaic overflow" from the first encounter. 
            The fireteam must split into three teams this time, consisting of two Mote Teams and one Building Team. 
            Each role will be explained in enough detail to take down the Sanctified Mind, and beat the Garden of Salvation Raid.
          </p>
          <p>
            The building team, though considered to require the most skill, requires the least amount of desrciption. 
            The final boss will slowly begin to take away segmented platforms of the arena (10 total; see diagram). 
            Usually, the buidling team only focuses on keeping the front most platforms active. These platforms can be "rebuilt" by connecting the closest tether box, which is located on the top of either the "dark" or "light" relay, to each platform's respective tether box ending. 
            As the safe portion of the arena are these platforms, this team must stay vigilant to keep as much of the arena available as possible. 
            Piece of advice, stay away from platforms when they are being destroyed or rebuilt, as an animation will play showing this process, but once completed will kill any Gaurdian within this section.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each mote team has the same job, working together on the same goal, yet functioning sperately from each other. 
            They must collect thirty motes (minimum) to fill both the dark and light relays, which will be used later to begin the damage phase. 
            Each relay requires their own color of mote, hence the light and dark designation. 
            Looking left to right across the arena, the far left island will always have enemies that drop light motes, and the far right side will always have enemies that drop dark motes. 
            To get to these islands, the boss must be shot on two glowing portions of it's body, which drops a portal on the ground below (see diagram). 
            This also represents the motes one will receive when entering into that portal (shooting the glowing sections on the left leg will spawn the light portal to the left side islands; shooting the right shoulder will spawn the dark portal to the right side islands).
          </p>
          <p>
            The rotation goes as follows: 
            Mote Team 1 enters the left side portal, collects all motes by killing all enemies, is teleported back to bank these motes while Mote Team 2 does exactly what Mote Team 1 just completed; Mote Team 2 is teleported back, banks their light motes on left side just like Mote Team 1 did, then these same steps are repeated from the right hand side.
            If done correctly, without any sacrafices, each relay will have displayed a message saying it is filled, and the damage phase will begin shortly after doing so. 
            If not done fast enough, chaos ensues as the boss will still force damage phase to begin, even if one or more relays are not ready.
          </p>
          <p>
            If not already confusing enough, damage phase gets chaotic even with some decently coordinated teammates. 
            The boss will walk forward, making a gesture with it's large hand, then spawns a massive tether box end, which will be glowing with the respective color of either the light or dark relay. 
            To clarify, the "light" relay is a blue color, while the "dark" relay is an orange color. 
            To make the boss damagable, the team must complete a (comparitively) longer tether from the respective color relay to the massive tether box end that the boss spawns. 
            Once this chain has been established, a loud noise cue will play, sounding like a shield being broken. 
            The team can now fire upon the boss, hopefully doing enough damage to perfectly get the boss down to half health, resulting in a common "2-phase." 
            This means two phases of damage occur, which subsequently mean two rounds of all mechanics need to be performed.
            Though, so long as everyone survives, and enough damage is done, the raid is completed!
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a way to extend the damage phase, which is very short compared to other raid bosses. 
            Once the main color tether has been made, the tether box will reappear shortly after with the alternative color. 
            Creating a new link with this second color will next to double the total time being able to damage the boss. 
            The tradeoff is that about 4 people must stop doing damage and help work on this tether, so only the most experienced fireteams perform this.
