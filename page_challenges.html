          <h2>What are "Challenges?"</h2>
          <p>
            Challenges are a unique way to complete each raid encounter, which requires new strategies, new communication methods, and potentially multiple attempts. 
            By doing a challenge, however, the entire team is rewarded with an acheivement within your account and receives an extra loot drop from completing the encounter, within the new conditions. 
            If at any point the challenges condition is failed, the challenge can no longer be completed; it must be done to it's entriely, or not at all.

          <h2>First Encounter Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            This challenge requires that Gaurdians do not kill certain Cyclopes through the encounter.
            Other than the first room, and the "final stand" room, any Cyclopes that spawn in rooms 2 and 3 cannot be killed.
            This challenges tests the team's ability to work around a massively annyoing enemy, and to ensure and area of effect damage is not used near these enemies.
            Compared to the rest of the raid, this is the easiest of the four to complete.

          <h2>Second Encounter Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            This second challenge requires that all Gaurdians must get the enlightened buff at relatively the same time. 
            Some playtesting has occured, which reveals that there is about a 3-5 second buffer between when both groups of Gaurdians tethes and gets their enlightened buff. 
            How this functions is simply described as a harder way to tether. 
            The set-up is perhaps the hardest part, as the first enlightened buff occurs, the game is now able to spawn shielded enemies at any relay, even if you are not near it during the set up (i.e., shielded enemies at relay 4, even if no Gaurdians have been there yet). 
            So, three people stay at relay 1 to start, while the other three head to relay 2. 
            Everyone calls to tether on a countdown, then once buffed, each group moves up by one relay. 
            Eventually, all telepporting portals will be active, and the group will be able to teleport to relays 1 and 3, where the two teams of three (i.e., both defenders and the one runner per each side of the arena) are able to countdown and tether together, as all players' timers are the same since all enlighted buffs are acheived at the same time universally. 
            The only remaining challenge, outside of defending the relays, is to ensure everyone is able to get enlighted once in the middle of the arena, ensuring all Gaurdians are lined up one after the other so everyone still can get enlightened.
            Compared to the challenges of the raid, this one is tied for the hardest.

          <h2>Third Encounter Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            This challenges requires that motes must be banked in 10-10-10 fashion, instead of 5-10-10-5. 
            This is only a challenges truly for the mote team, as they just need to be faster when killing the minotaurs; the team that stays on the boss has no changes.
            This is accepted as slightly harder than the first challenge in the raid, as it requires Gaurdians to prioritze speed over anything.

          <h2>Fourth Encounter Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            Probably the hardest challenge to explain, but seems like it will be easy once understood/practiced. 
            This challenge requires the relays to be filled (0-30 motes) in under ten second from the inital deposit. 
            The way this is going to work will be this: There will be 2 teams of three, with one team only going on left (light), and the other only going on right (dark). 
            Within these teams, there will be a Team A and a Team B, with Team A consisting of 2/3 of the people and Team B only having one person. 
            Once the boss lights up with the shootable areas for the portals, both A teams will shoot and enter their respective sides. 
            Once in there, only pick up a maximum of 9 motes, (ex. Two people grab 7). 
            Then, once ready, team B (the solos) will teleport you out of that side, and enter their respective sides instantly. They need to grab the full 10 as fast as possible. 
            Team A, listen for their calls to pull them as time will start not be a challenge. 
            Once Team B has been teleported, then Team A runs back in to completely fill their mote counter, which also refreshes their timer. 
            Team B will pull Team A out one last time, then its time to bank one, after the other, after the other. 
            From then, assuming nothing has gone wrong, both relays should be filled and its time for damage.
          </p>
          <p>
            To answer a few questions: No there is no building team, as simply there is not enough time for it. 
            Sure, if you wanted to rebuild a platform or two when team A is back at the boss you can, but the importance is on bringing enough Gaurdians that can heal others, so that even if all of the safe platforms are gone, people can still heal while taking damage from the non-floor.
            What about the shielded, enlightened mobs? 
            Well, they only spawn when motes have been deposited, which is how the encounter typically works. 
            So, as long as everyone deposits very fast, no shielded enemies will spawn.
