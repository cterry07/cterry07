          <h2>What are "Triumphs?"</h2>
          <p>
            Like the challenges, triumphs are another alternative way to execute an encounter, which again result in a new challenge for the entire fireteam.
            Unlike the challenges, triumphs award no extra loot, other than an acheivement. 
            These can be completed for an acheivement within the raid's acheivement page, but usually are purely for completionists to work towards a title. 
            A title is a small label displayed above a Gaurdians nametag which displaces sigificant competence within a given activity. 
            If at any point the triumph condition is failed, the triumph can no longer be completed; it must be done to it's entirety, or not at all. 
            Be careful, unlike the challenges, you will not be notified when the triumph for the current encounter is failed.

          <h2>First Encounter Triumph</h2>
          <p>
            The triumph for the first encounter now adds more of a role to the players with the voltaic overflow buff, as well as making this aforementioned game of leap frog more complicated. 
            For this triumph, only players that have the voltaic overflow buff can use the tether boxes.
            Now, this sounds difficult, however this is really a test on communication.
            The team no longer splits into distinct teams, instead they ensure a proper order of which players will get this buff first.
            All tether boxes in this encounter need 3 players, so once you have three players, you can progress the encounter by linking tether boxes, opening barriers, and surviving to the end.

          <h2>Second Encounter Triumph</h2>
          <p>
            This second triumph also tweaks how the enlightened buff is handled.
            During this encounter, refreshing the enlightened buff can only be done after it has completely run out.
            This means players are once again heavily communicating, but also paying attention to when their buff runs out, so that they can get it ASAP.
            Recall, that defenders must have this buff to defeat any enemy after a certain amount of time in this encounter, as enemies with white shields can only be defeated with this buff active.
            Essentially, this triumph purposely slows the entire team down.
            The setup can work almost identical to either the challenge or running the encounter noramally, however it is defintely extremely chaotic.

          <h2>Third Encounter Triumph</h2>
          <p>
            This triumph is the easiest out of the four, so long as players are extremely careful. 
            Once again challenging the Mote Team, who are the primary users of the enlightened buff to defend the sole relay, this challenge is essentially trigger discipline.
            Anyone with the enlightened buff cannot kill a single enemy.
            So, the mote team instantly sends one player to defend the relay, as shielded enemies will not spawn for some time. 
            Once the second player arrives, they are responsible for only shooting the shields off enemies. 
            That's right, the first shot of any enlightened player simply removes the shield from the enemy, and players without the buff can kill. 
            Other than this, the encounter continues as normal, just with usually two players on the mote team at the relay before damage phase, at all times. 
            One thing to be careful about, which can fail the triumph with the final shot on the boss, is that if an enlightened player lands the final blow on the boss, this technically counts as a enemy kill and will not award players with the triumph. 
            So, if a player still has this buff, they usually pay close attention to the boss' health, and stops shooting once close to finishing the encounter.

          <h2>Fourth Encounter Triumph</h2>
          <p>
            The fourth and final triumph is by far the hardest general challenge to the fireteam. 
            This triumph requires the fireteam to be forced into a game of attrition. 
            While the Mote Teams are uneffected, the build team takes priotity with this triumph: they must destroy 20 enemies by using the "vex instantiation" method, or more simply known as the rebuilding mechanic. 
            Not only must the buid team wait for the platofrms to be taken away, but they also have to juggle killing enemies in time before they sacrafice to the relay. 
            One way to accomplish this is to wait for one relay to be entirely filled, which enemies will still walk toward, but can no longer sacrafice to. 
            So, if this method is done correctly, the build team will have a large grouping of enemies standing on the area without a platform, directly in front of the relay. 
            Once they connect the rebuild tether, and the platform is rebuilt, just like if any Gaurdians are in the area when it occurs, enemies will also be killed.
